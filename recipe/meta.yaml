  summary: Implements various procedures for finding  multiple change-points. Two methods make use of dynamic  programming and pruning, with no distributional  assumptions other than the existence of certain absolute  moments in one method. Hierarchical and exact search methods  are included. All methods return the set of
    estimated change- points as well as other summary information.
